We were compelled to break the ice amongst us, freshers, by participating in the team based activities. This team based approach continued in our core curriculum classes as well In addition to the impeccable teaching at NMAMIT, Abhyuday, the Placement and Student Welfare Team plays a crucial role in students; holistic development. I got an opportunity in my very first year to start a placement newsletter called RUBIK, in an attempt to help the 3rd and final year students to prepare for college placements. I was also included in organizing major events such as “TEDx”, “Microsoft Dreamspark Yatra” and concert of “Band of Boys” on campus.
